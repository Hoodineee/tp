# User Guide

Watson is a **desktop app for teachers that helps with a multitude of tasks, such as handling student particulars, sorting students with many different features, and more. It adopts a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interfac (GUI). If you can type fast, Watson can retrieve and handle the data of students faster than other GUI-based applications.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `watson.jar` from here (Hyperlink will be added in the future).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Watson.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`list`** : Lists all persons in Watson.

    * **`add`**`id/12345678 n/John Doe p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a person named `John Doe` to Watson.

    * **`delete`**`id/12345678` : Deletes the person with `ID number 12345678` from Watson.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a user-defined input. An example would be `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `TAG` in `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be excluded. The command can be run as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
